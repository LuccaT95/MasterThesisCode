# Master's Thesis

This repository contains the accompanying code to my master's thesis "Symmetric Chain Decompositions of Combinatorial Posets" written at TU Berlin.

## Prerequisites for running the Python scripts

In order to execute the scripts *SCD_P4* or *SCD_H3*, they have to be run with the Python executable that comes with SageMath in which PySAT was installed. The process is explained here:
 - SageMath: https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/faq/faq-usage.html#how-do-i-import-sage-into-a-python-script 
 - Installation PySAT: https://pysathq.github.io/installation/

In order to execute the script *BraidCoverGraph*, PyGraphviz and Pyrsistent must be installed as explained here:
 
 - Installation PyGraphviz: https://pygraphviz.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html
 - Installation Pyrsistent: https://pyrsistent.readthedocs.io/en/v0.20.0/intro.html#installation
